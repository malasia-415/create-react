# create-react
  You're going to build an application called Noteful. This application will be built up over several checkpoints as we first create the design and basic components with routing, and then move onto integrating the API calls. We'll also be building the back-end for this application in the Node curriculum!

To start, create a new create-react-app project called noteful and remove the boilerplate code to have a clean starting point.

This assignment is to build the basic components for 3 routes based off of the wireframes we'll supply below. You don't need to implement any API calls or functionality to manage the notes just yet as we'll get to that in later checkpoints.

Requirements

There are 3 routes to build: the main route, the dynamic folder route, and a dynamic note route. We'll supply you with 3 wireframes for each of these pages and you'll then need to create the semantic (accessible) HTML for these as well as basic styling.
